# Information gathering with Burp Suite
1. Setup firefox with Burp (foxyproxy)
2. Navigate to website
3. Go to target tab -- this will pull the sites that it connects to
4. dig into the domain and navigate for web technologies
5. Look for request as well as response
6. This may give service name (which would be a low finding)
